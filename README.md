Introduction
===========

*Fed up with how TuneIn tries to be a social network these days? How it has problems running streams even if other apps do it just fine without setting the buffer to 30 seconds or more (and then still has trouble playing the stream)? Would you like an alarm feature that actually works reliably? Would you like Chromecast [1] support with that?*

Well, I think Icerrr may be just the thing for you!

And it get's better: Icerrr is FREE [2]

Icerrr is FMAlarm's successor and currently (heavily) under development. It's built with Cordova/Phonegap and should eventually also support iOS and regular browsers. 

For now, it's just the Android app.

Expect updates. And probably a bug here and there. But you'll be helping me building this thing by using it and reporting bugs, feature requests, etc.
