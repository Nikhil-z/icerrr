Introduction
===========

Looking for a clean and simple radio streaming app that lets you set alarms, cast your stream to Chromecast and supports Android Wear?

Well, I think Icerrr may be just the thing for you!

And it gets better: Icerrr is free! [2]

Note: The album art and info in the screenshots are fake because Google will suspend this app for showing imagery that is copyright protected. I know because they did. Blame the entertainment industry.

[1] Chromecast support is prototype-ish.
[2] Icerrr can be downloaded for free for at least a limited period of time.
